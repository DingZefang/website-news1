VARIETY
All of the data is has expanded to be as vast as the amount of sources that generate data. Data could be sourced from email messages, sound players, video recorders, watches, personal devices, computers, wellness monitoring systems,  satellites..etc. Each device that's recording data is usually recording and encoding it in a different structure and design. Additionally, the data produced from these devices also can vary by granularity, timing, schema and pattern. The reward that variety provides is versatility to store various kinds of details without enforcing traditional relational constraints. A lot of the data created is founded on object structures that extremely based on an event, individual, location or transaction. Having data recorded in a flexible framework that can vary provides specific and biased details.

Data selections for varied resource and forms implies that traditional relational databases and structures can't be used to interpret and shop these details. This poses a problem because many businesses still cling to SQL and the relational globe as they have for many years. NoSQL technologies will be the solution to go us forward due to the flexible strategy they provide to storing and reading data without imposing strict relational bindings. NoSQL systems such as for example Document Shops and Column Stores currently provide a good substitute to OLTP/relational database technology in addition to read/create speeds that are considerably faster. 

VELOCITY
The velocity of data streaming is incredibly fast paced. Technology has progressed to become integrated with all areas of human life and therefore data is produced across nearly every interaction that human beings make. Every millisecond, systems all around the global world are producing data based on events and interactions. Devices like center monitors, televisions, RFID visitors and scanners monitors generate data in the millisecond. Servers, weather gadgets, and internet sites generate data at the next. As technology furthers, it could not be astonishing to see gadgets that produced data also at the nanosecond. The incentive that data velocity provides is normally information instantly which can be harnessed to create near real-time decisions or actions. The majority of the traditional insights we've derive from aggregations of actuals more than months and days. Having data at the grain of milliseconds or secs will provide a far more detailed and vivid details. 

Organizations are often overwhelmed in embracing the amount of information that is produced and available for them. Managing the quantity of data that's produced every day is becoming a significant problem. With the speed where data is produced, it equally demands, if not quicker, technology and tools in order to extract, procedure and analyze the info. Traditional technology of extracting, transforming and storing data may longer deal with the vast plenty of data no. This limitation has result in the emergence of Big Data technologies and architectures. NoSQL, Distributed and Support Oriented Systems. 

NoSQL systems replace traditional OLTP/relational database technology because they place less importance about ACID (Atomicity, Regularity, Isolation, Durability) concepts and are in a position to read/write information at considerably faster speeds.
Distributed and Load Balancing systems have finally become a  regular in all institutions to split and distribute the strain of extracting, examining and processing data throughout a number of servers. This allows for huge amounts of data to become prepared in high speeds which remove bottle necks.
Enterprise Assistance Bus  (ESB) systems replace traditional integration frameworks written in custom made code. These distributed and conveniently scalable systems enable serialization across large workloads and applications to procedure huge amounts of data to a number of different applications and systems.  

VOLUME
Today easily overshadows all of the data we have produced in the past the volume of data generated. If we take all the data produced in the global world between the beginning of time and 2008, the same amount of data will be produced every minute! Tied to Velocity closely, technology has evolved to be integrated with all aspects of human life nearly. As a result, vast amounts of touchpoints generate Zettabytes and Petabytes of data. On social mass media and telecommunication sites by itself, billions of messages, clicks and uploads happen everyday.  The reward that this data volume provides is information for each touchpoint almost. We have information for each interaction now, perspective and alternate. Having this different data allows us to more effectively analyze, predict, test and eventually prescribe to our customers.

Large selections of data in conjunction with the issues of Variety (different formats) and Velocity (near real-time generation) pose significant managing costs to organizations. Regardless of the speed of Moore's Law, the task to store large data sets can much longer be met with traditional databases or data stores no. The strengths of distributed storage space systems like SAN (STORAGE SPACE Network) and also NoSQL data shops that can effectively divide, compress and store huge amounts of data with improved read/write performances. 

Provided below is an excellent illustrative break down of the 3 Versus described over.  In context, a fourth V, Veracity is referenced often. Veracity concerns the data quality accuracy and risks as data is produced at such a high and distributed frequency. In solving the task of the 3 Vs, organization put little emphasis or function into cleaning up the info and filtering on what's necessary and because of this the credibility and dependability of data have experienced.
